# Hand-Written-Digits-ANN

The goal of this project was to train three fully connected layered models using data consisiting of pictures of hand written digits.
I used an Artifical Neural Netowk to analyze the data

## Dataset

The trainig data set consists of hand written digits representing either 0 or 1. each image is grayscale 28 x 28
The testing data set is the same
